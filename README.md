# ABCD container images
Images of several clone detector tools. All are modified so that they can be used in the [ABCD platform](https://github.com/Glopix/abcd).
  
The images are available on the [Package page](https://github.com/users/Glopix/packages?repo_name=abcd-images).


## Current available images of clone detector tools
The licences of the clone detectors remains unchanged. No changes have been made to their source code.  
In general, the software was only compiled, a runner script was added and it was containerised according to the ABCD platform standards.
