# Cloreco container images
Images of several clone detector tools and clone benchmark frameworks. All are modified so that they can be used in the [Cloreco platform](https://github.com/Glopix/cloreco).
  
The images are available on the [Package page](https://github.com/users/Glopix/packages?repo_name=cloreco-images).


## Current available images of clone detector tools
The licences of all clone detectors remains unchanged. No changes have been made to their source code.  
In general, the software was only compiled, a runner script was added and it was containerised according to the Cloreco platform standards.
